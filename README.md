# Summary 
The SouthPark Game on the N64 is one  the most difficult games I have  ever  played.The object of the game is to save the town from the evil turkeys and aliens.

# Contol
One hurdle was the controller,specifically the camera.It is extreme;y difficult to control as it is extremely sensitive and refocusing is a challenge. The camera is necessary to help the player focus, when moved the player moves the same way. ALsO, there is no zoom modein the shooting function.

# Enemies
The enemies move quickly and there are generally groups of five to ten. Because of the scattering and not being able to focus, it is hard to beat these levels. If you are lucky, the enemies will get stuck with in the level structure.

# MulityPlayer
The multi player is fun because you are able to unlock other characters.However the primitive map showing player locstion is difficult to follow.It is hard to figure where your opponent is.
# Overall,
a tester would need to look at these functions a little more carefully to try and allow playing to be easier and more organized. Being a fan of the show< I continue to enjoy this game, despite its flaws.
